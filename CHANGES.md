CHANGES
=======

1.4 (2023-11-23)
----------------

- `SDConstants` class
  - Replaced `"type"` in the `RETAINED_CLAIMS` set with `"vct"` to align with
    the breaking change by the draft 01 of the SD-JWT VC specification.

1.3 (2023-06-22)
----------------

- New types
  - `SDObjectDecoder` class
  - `SDObjectEncoder` class

1.2 (2023-06-19)
----------------

Update to follow the following normative changes of the SD-JWT specification.

1. A tilde (`~`) is appended to "Combined Format for Issuance", resulting in
   that there is no formal difference between (a) Combined Format for Issuance
   and (b) Combined Format for Presentation without a binding JWT.
2. The format of the base JSON of Disclosure for an array element has changed
   from `[salt, [name, index], value]` to `[salt, value]`.
3. Disclosures for array elements are not put in the `_sd` array. Instead,
   each array element is replaced with `{"...": "<digest>"}`.
4. Terminology changes. The terms "Combined Format for Issuance" and "Combined
   Format for Presentation" are obsoleted, and the entire combined format is
   called "SD-JWT".
